# Covid19-Analysis

## Aim:
The project aimed to analyze COVID-19 data by calling COVID-19 websites' APIs, extracting the data in JSON format, and performing analysis using SQL. The goal was to gain insights from the data and create a dashboard based on the findings.
<br>

## Description:
The project involved cleaning and pre-processing the data extracted from the COVID-19 websites' APIs. This included handling missing or inconsistent data, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. The JSON data was transformed into a structured format of dataframe in Python, to facilitate analysis.
<br>

##  Data Exploration and Analysis:
After the data cleaning stage, data exploration and analysis were conducted using SQL. This involved querying the structured data to retrieve relevant information and perform calculations, aggregations, and statistical operations. The analysis aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to COVID-19.

## Conclusion:
    - Through the facts and the data we had, we can say that when lockdown was removed at that time the cases started to spike again.
    - 2020 had more covid deaths then 2021.
    - People who had health issues died more in covid 19.
    - At the End of 2020 cases were the lowest.

## Challenges Faced:
    - During the project, there were several limitations and challenges encountered. Extracting data from JSON format might have posed a challenge, especially if it was new to the project team.
    - SQL for analysis have required learning new skills or overcoming technical difficulties.
